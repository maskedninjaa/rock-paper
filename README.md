This project is not done from scratch at all. I followed along a video tutorial on youtube given by freeCodeCamp.org (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaVNP3nIAv0)

This is my first project I've done outside of java, using javascript, css, and html. 

All html and css is in the html file, and all javascript is the js file.
